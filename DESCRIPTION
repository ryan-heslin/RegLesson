Description: This package implements linear regression and basic diagnostic tests from the ground up using nothing but the `base` and `stats` packages. Primarily a learning exercise, I wrote it to prepare for a linear regression course, practice designing S3 classes, and enhance my capabilities using no external dependencies.
